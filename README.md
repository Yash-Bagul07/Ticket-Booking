## About The Project

Seatify is a feature-rich, single-page web application for browsing movies and booking tickets. Built from the ground up with modern web technologies, it provides a seamless and responsive user experience, from searching for a show to selecting seats and completing the booking process.

This project was developed to showcase a complete user flow for a ticketing service, incorporating dynamic data from an external API, robust state management, and a fully interactive UI.
